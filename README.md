## Instructions

- G - Place glider
- S - Place Spaceship
- U - Place Glider Gun
- C - Change color of active squares (cycle between red, green, and blue)
- R - Clear the board

- Left Click - Fill in cell (supports dragging the cursor to color in squares)
- Right Click - Erase cell (supports dragging the cursor to color in squares)
